This file serves as a placeholder for a basic Unity project structure related to Chapter 3.
A full Unity project cannot be directly generated here. Users should create a Unity project, install the ROS-Unity Integration package, and import robot models as described in the chapter.
The RobotController.cs script is provided separately.
