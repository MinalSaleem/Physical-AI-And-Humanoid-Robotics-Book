Specify the requirements for Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) in a Docusaurus-based book on AI-native robotics. The module must focus on ROS 2 as middleware for robot control. Key sections: - Introduction to ROS 2 nodes, topics, and services with definitions, diagrams, and simple examples. - Bridging Python agents to ROS controllers using rclpy, including setup steps, code snippets for publishing/subscribing, and error handling. - Understanding URDF for humanoids, covering file structure, joints/links, and a basic humanoid example. Use an educational tone with prerequisites (e.g., basic Python knowledge). Output as MDX-compatible structure with frontmatter. Ensure the spec is SMART: specific (4-6 pages equivalent), measurable (include 3-5 code examples), achievable (use standard ROS 2 concepts), relevant (ties to AI agents in robotics), time-bound (implementable in 2-4 tasks). Document any constraints like no proprietary code. ------------------------------------ Based on the provided constitution for the "Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics" book, create a detailed specification document for writing a technical "Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)". PROJECT DETAILS: Book Title: "Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics" Module: Module 1 of a The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) Target Audience: Advanced undergraduate to graduate level Format: Technical documentation integrated with Docusaurus CHAPTERS TO COVER: Chapter 1: Introduction to ROS 2 Middleware for Robot Control Chapter 2: ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services Chapter 3: Bridging Python Agents to ROS Controllers using rclpy Chapter 4: Understanding URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) for Humanoids REQUIREMENTS: Each chapter should have theoretical explanations, practical examples, and summaries. Code examples should be in Python using ROS 2 Include diagrams and visual aids where necessary Progressive difficulty: beginner-friendly to advanced concepts Integration with Docusaurus for web documentation of 01-module-one Include best practices and common pitfalls DELIVERABLES: Markdown files for each chapter Code snippets (without full implementations) Glossary of terms Please create only for module 1.
