# Checklist: Technical Content and Accuracy for "Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics"

**Purpose**: This checklist provides a high-level sanity check for authors to validate the quality, clarity, and completeness of requirements related to the technical content and accuracy of the "Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics" book specification.

**Created**: 2025-12-10
**Feature**: 001-create-book-spec
**Audience**: Author(s) of the book spec
**Focus**: Technical Content and Accuracy

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 - Are all core concepts of "physical AI" and "humanoid robotics" explicitly listed as topics to be covered? [Completeness, Gap]
- [ ] CHK002 - Is there a defined process or guideline for ensuring the technical accuracy of all content (concepts, examples, pseudocode)? [Completeness, Gap]
- [ ] CHK003 - Are guidelines provided for the appropriate level of detail and complexity for the target audience (advanced undergraduate to graduate-level)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-004]
- [ ] CHK004 - Are requirements for balancing theory and practical examples explicitly stated and measurable? [Completeness, Spec §FR-004]
- [ ] CHK005 - Are requirements defined for reviewing and updating technical content to maintain accuracy over time (e.g., as the field evolves)? [Completeness, Gap]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK006 - Is "Physical AI" and "Humanoid Robotics" clearly defined within the spec to ensure consistent interpretation across chapters? [Clarity, Gap]
- [ ] CHK007 - Is the content of the "Key Concepts" section explicitly defined to prevent ambiguity in what should be included? [Clarity, Spec §FR-003]
- [ ] CHK008 - Are criteria for "Illustrative Examples" (pseudocode only) clear to ensure no full code implementations are included? [Clarity, Spec §FR-003, §FR-006]
- [ ] CHK009 - Are the types and scope of "Exercises" (conceptual, analytical, design-focused) clearly delineated? [Clarity, Spec §FR-003]
- [ ] CHK010 - Is "conceptual simulations" clearly distinguished from "full code implementations" to avoid confusion? [Clarity, Spec §FR-007, §FR-006]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK011 - Are the definitions of "physical AI" and "humanoid robotics" consistently applied throughout all requirements and planned content? [Consistency, Gap]
- [ ] CHK012 - Do the content guidelines for chapters (FR-003) align with the pedagogical approach (FR-004)? [Consistency, Spec §FR-003, §FR-004]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK013 - Can the "clarity, accuracy, and understandability" of the book's content (SC-002) be objectively measured beyond a post-usage survey? [Measurability, Spec §SC-002]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK014 - Are requirements specified for handling potentially outdated technical information or rapidly evolving concepts in AI/Robotics? [Edge Case, Gap]
