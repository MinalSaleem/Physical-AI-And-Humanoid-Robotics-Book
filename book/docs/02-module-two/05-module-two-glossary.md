# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) - Glossary

This glossary provides definitions for key terms and concepts introduced in Module 2.

## C

**Collision Geometry**: A simplified shape (e.g., box, sphere, cylinder) used by a physics engine to detect contact between objects in a simulation, typically less complex than visual geometry to improve performance.

**Contact Sensor**: A type of sensor in simulation environments (like Gazebo) that detects and reports physical contact between specified parts of a robot or environment.

## D

**DART (Dynamic Animation and Robotics Toolkit)**: A physics engine optimized for robotics and biomechanics research, offering advanced capabilities for collision and contact handling in simulations.

**Depth Camera**: A sensor that produces an image where each pixel's value corresponds to the distance from the camera to the scene object, commonly used for 3D reconstruction and object detection in simulations.

**Digital Twin**: A virtual representation or model of a physical object or system, used for simulation, testing, monitoring, and optimization in a virtual environment.

## G

**Gazebo**: A powerful open-source 3D robot simulator that provides robust physics engines, high-quality graphics, and convenient interfaces for simulating robots and environments.

## I

**IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)**: An electronic device that measures and reports a body's specific force (acceleration), angular rate (gyroscope), and sometimes magnetic field, crucial for localization and control in both real and simulated robots.

**Inertia Tensor**: A 3x3 matrix that describes how mass is distributed about an object's center of mass, influencing its rotational motion when forces or torques are applied.

## J

**Joint (in URDF/SDF)**: A connection between two links in a robot model, defining the axis of rotation or translation and enabling relative motion.

## L

**LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)**: A remote sensing method that uses pulsed laser to measure distances, generating 3D point clouds of the environment, often used for navigation and mapping in simulations.

**Link (in URDF/SDF)**: A rigid body segment of a robot model, representing a physical component with defined visual, collision, and inertial properties.

## O

**ODE (Open Dynamics Engine)**: A popular, high-performance physics engine used in Gazebo for simulating rigid body dynamics with contacts.

## P

**Physics Engine**: A software component that simulates physical interactions (e.g., gravity, collisions, friction) between objects in a virtual environment.

## S

**SDF (Simulation Description Format)**: An XML file format used in Gazebo to describe robot models and simulation environments, often extending URDF with simulation-specific properties.

**Sensor (Simulated)**: A virtual device within a simulation environment designed to mimic the output of real-world sensors (e.g., LiDAR, cameras, IMUs), providing data for testing AI algorithms.

## U

**Unity**: A cross-platform real-time 3D development platform known for high-fidelity rendering, advanced graphics, and tools for human-robot interaction and simulation, often used for visually rich digital twins.
